\section{Current Review Status}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item Release status: Released.
  \item Release version: \texttt{v1.1.0}.
  \item Release date: 2026-02-18.
\end{itemize}

\section{Review Inputs Used}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item RTM evidence confirms FR-01 to FR-06 and NFR-01 to NFR-04 as pass.
  \item Test execution log in \texttt{07\_test\_cases.tex} with TC-01 to TC-10 pass.
  \item Lighthouse evidence and reduced-motion verification captured during QA.
\end{itemize}

\section{Objectives vs Outcomes}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item Objective: Deliver interactive night-sky activation and aurora animation using vanilla JS.
  \item Outcome: Achieved in MVP release \texttt{v1.1.0}.
  \item Objective: Complete baseline SDLC documentation and traceability.
  \item Outcome: Achieved with synchronized Plan, SRS, SDS, Test, RTM, and release docs.
\end{itemize}

\section{What Went Well}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item Requirement traceability remained consistent from SRS through RTM.
  \item Accessibility and reduced-motion behavior were included and validated before release.
  \item Defect D-01 (keyboard activation inconsistency) was closed before go-live.
\end{itemize}

\section{What Did Not Go Well}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item Keyboard activation behavior required a correction cycle during testing.
  \item Release readiness tracking required multiple manual sync steps across documents.
\end{itemize}

\section{Lessons Learned}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item Run keyboard and reduced-motion checks earlier in implementation sprints.
  \item Keep test evidence updates batched with code changes to reduce drift.
  \item Keep release checklist result recorded immediately after tag publication.
\end{itemize}
